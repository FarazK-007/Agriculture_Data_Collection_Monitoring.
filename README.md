Farmers doesn't have proper Data.
Idea to overcome this:
There will be Android App for Farmers which will provide feature like Weather Forecast  related Data Information about Crops planted in certain States. [For example, In Maharashtra - Wheat 42% have been planted]... This will give great idea for Farmers to plan which Crop they needed to plant.
And Web App for Crop Seller to manage and generate bills of Crops that are Sold. This will help for Data Collection.
