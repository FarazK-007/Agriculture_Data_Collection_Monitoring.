    Title: Agriculture Data Collection and Monitoring.

# Abstract: 
    As we all know in India there is lot of issues related to Agriculture (i.e. On Farming). For example,  Heavy nonseasonal rainfall has locked latest onion produce in wet fields throughout onion growing states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana. As a ripple effect, onion prices increased everywhere in the country.
    This happens because of:
        Natural Disasters or
        Farmers doesn't have proper Data.

# Idea to overcome this:
    There will be Android App for Farmers which will provide feature like Weather Forecast  related Data Information about Crops planted in certain States. [For example, In Maharashtra - Wheat 42% have been planted]... This will give great idea for Farmers to plan which Crop they needed to plant.
    And Web App for Crop Seller to manage and generate bills of Crops that are Sold. This will help for Data Collection.
